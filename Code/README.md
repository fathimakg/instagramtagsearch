All three of our codes contain sections for downloading the data, preprocessing it, and training and testing a particular neural net architecture.

The ConvNet code takes inspiration from XXX and contains two convolution layers followed by three fully connected layers. Running the code will download the data (if needed), apply a scaling transformation, train the net on the STL-10 data set, and then calculate the testing and training accuracies and confusion matrices. Detailed results and model description can be found in the reports section.
