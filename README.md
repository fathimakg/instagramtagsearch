# Final-Project-Group-7

Our repository contains folders corresponding to our codes, proposal, report, and presentation. Our project focused on implimenting various network achitechtures using Python and PyTorch. Within the code section we have python scripts that use corresponding to our various architechtures used. A more detailed account of the architectures as well as our results can be seen in the report and presentation sections respectively. 
 The code book MLP_code_dropout.py contains the code for Using MultiLayer Perceptron on the STL-10 dataset.
 The code MLP-STL-10-FINAL.py contains the code for Using MultiLayer Perceptron on the STL-10 dataset with the introduction of dropout nodes.
